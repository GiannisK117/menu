Through the creation of the Fish class, I have deepened my understanding of Class Design and the core concept of Encapsulation in Java. I learned how to define diverse data types—such as String, double, and boolean—to represent the attributes of a real-world object. I practiced implementing Constructor Overloading by providing both a default and a parameterized constructor, allowing for flexible object initialization. Furthermore, I solidified my knowledge of Accessor and Mutator methods (getters and setters) to safely manage class fields and the use of the this keyword to distinguish between instance variables and parameters. Finally, I learned how to create custom instance methods like displayInfo() to format and present object state data clearly to the console.
