Through the creation of the Fish class, I have deepened my understanding of Class Design and the core concept of Encapsulation in Java. I learned how to define diverse data types—such as String, double, and boolean—to represent the attributes of a real-world object. I practiced implementing Constructor Overloading by providing both a default and a parameterized constructor, allowing for flexible object initialization. Furthermore, I solidified my knowledge of Accessor and Mutator methods (getters and setters) to safely manage class fields and the use of the this keyword to distinguish between instance variables and parameters. Finally, I learned how to create custom instance methods like displayInfo() to format and present object state data clearly to the console.
By integrating the Fish, Shark, and MarineOrganism classes along with the main execution logic, I have mastered the ability to design and manage complex object hierarchies and data collections in Java. I learned how to model real-world entities using Encapsulation, ensuring that attributes like depth and danger levels are protected through accessors and mutators. I gained significant experience in Array Processing, creating static methods to iterate through object arrays to perform calculations—such as computing the average habitat depth and filtering organisms based on specific boolean criteria. Furthermore, I enhanced the user experience by incorporating the Scanner class for interactive decision-making and utilized String formatting to present scientific data with mathematical precision. This comprehensive project solidified my understanding of how a modular, multi-class system functions, from the basic definition of a Fish to the high-level management of a diverse marine ecosystem.
